# Let's improove BIM through RFCs!

&nbsp;

### Motivation
The projected was started off by a frastrated indivudla in AEC industory on the
current status of BIM implementations and developmetns.  

To be specific, it was a series of the open letters to Autodesk that realyl trigered this project. As much as Autodesk probably has been neglecting lots of user expereinces; to me, those, who wrote letters, are much of the same. Despite their authorities and status as BIM
managers from large established architectural design offices, the letters lack
in technicalities and specifities on how Autodesk should actaully imrpvoe the
product.  

What's worse? Recomending themselves as a leading voice in this
frontier.  

Then, who'd represent voices of designers, architects, engineers etc
who face unreasbnoble demands from the lcietns day-to-day? In short, their core
value don't seem to be to reresent the user expereinces of actual end users but
rather somewhere else.

### What is this about?
RFC (Request for Comments) is a process widely used in the software development
to get comments and create discussions before new featuers are implmented. The
core value of the process is for software developers to ensure that whatever the new feature would be something useful and benefitial for the wide part of the actual users.

### How to Get Involved?
lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
lorem ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book. it has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. it was popularised 
in the 1960s with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages,
and more recently with desktop publishing software like aldus pagemaker including 
versions of lorem ipsum.
