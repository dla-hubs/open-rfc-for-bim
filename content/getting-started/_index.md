# Getting Started

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the simplest term,
[a public repository on GitHub](https://www.url.com) is used to manage all the
RFC contents as well as the website itself through the static web generator
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

&nbsp;

## What could RFCs be about?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no limit to what a topic may be as long as
it's related to BIMs in AEC industry. RFC should be about creating a positive
improvement to the digital design tools we use in the industry. For instance, it
can be about improving functionalities of:

- Software
- Guidelines/ standards
- APIs or other frameworks related to the software devs, etc.

&nbsp;

## Prerequisite

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The essential skills you need to be able to submit
an RFC. The links to the suggested readings are _in italic below_.

- Fork & Pull Request Workflow on GitHub
  [- Creating a pull request from fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
- Markdown [- Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Hugo [- What is Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GitHub workflow can be a little intimidating,
especially coming from non-software dev. background. Read through the guides
first and reach out to the communities via Discord or GitHub to get help!

&nbsp;

## Workflow Overview

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow the process below to create a new RFC.
[Read "RFC-001 RFC Process"](/rfc/001-rfc-process/) for a detailed guide. &nbsp;

1. Fork the repository on Git
2. Write up an RFC
3. Submit the PR (Pull Request)
4. Pick up comments and re-submit!

&nbsp;

## Before creating an RFC

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before starting drafting up a new RFC:

- **Search if there is already a similar RFC**\
  If there are already similar RFCs, you could consider modifying (pull request)
  the existing one other than starting from scratch. Even if they are not
  exactly the same and you decide to create a new RFC, it's good to be aware of
  the similar ones so that you can acknowledge them by adding links in your RFC.

- **Reach out to the community and discuss your idea**\
  This would be a better practice for the community since it would help to
  develop the RFC ensuring its relevance to the issue it's trying to solve.

&nbsp;

## Current limitation

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project currently accepts RFCs to be written and
presented fully in text and doesn't support any other multimedia.
