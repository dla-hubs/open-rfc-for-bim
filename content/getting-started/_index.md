# Getting Started

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the simplest term,
[a public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dla-hubs/open-rfc-for-bim/)
is used to manage all the RFC contents as well as the website itself through the
static web generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

&nbsp;

## What could RFCs be about?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no limit to what a topic may be as long as
it's related to BIMs in AEC industry. RFC should be about creating a positive
improvement to the digital design tools we use in the industry. For instance, it
can be about improving functionalities of:

- Software
- Guidelines/ standards
- APIs or other frameworks related to the software devs, etc.

&nbsp;

## Prerequisite

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The essential skills you need to be able to submit
an RFC. The links to the suggested readings are _in italic below_.

- Fork & Pull Request Workflow on GitHub
  [- Creating a pull request from fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
- Markdown [- Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Hugo [- What is Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GitHub workflow can be a little intimidating,
especially coming from non-software dev. background. Read through the guides
first and reach out to the communities via Discord or GitHub to get help!

&nbsp;

## Workflow Overview

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow the process below to create a new RFC.
[Read "RFC-001 RFC Process"](/rfc/001-rfc-process/) for a detailed guide. &nbsp;

1. Fork the repository on Git
2. Write up an RFC
3. Submit the PR (Pull Request)
4. Pick up comments and re-submit!

&nbsp;

## Search on the platform before creating an RFC

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before starting drafting up a new RFC, please spend
some time to search if there are already similar RFCs. You could consider
modifying (pull request) the existing one other than starting from scratch.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if they are not exactly the same and you decide
to create a new RFC, it's good to be aware of similar ones so that you can
acknowledge them by adding links in your RFC.

&nbsp;

## Current limitation

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project currently accepts RFCs to be written and
presented fully in text and doesn't support any other multimedia.
