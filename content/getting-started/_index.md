# Getting Started

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the simplest term,
[a public repository on GitHub](https://www.url.com) is used to manage all the
RFC contents as well as the website itself through the static web generator
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

&nbsp;

## What could RFCs be about?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no limit to what a topic may be as long as
it's related to digitial design in AEC insdustry. RFC should be about creating a
positive improvement to the dightal design tools we use in the industry. For
instance, it can be about imrpvoring a function of:

- Softwrares
- Implmentation guidelines/ standards
- APIs or other frameworks related to the software devs.

&nbsp;

## Prerequisite

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The essential skils you need to be able to submit a
RFC. The links to the suggested readings _in italic below_.

- Fork & Pull Request Workflow on GitHub
  [- Creating a pull request from fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
- Markdown [- Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Hugo [- What is Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GitHub workflow can be little intimidating,
especially coming from non-software dev. background. Read through the guides
first and reach to the communities via Discord or GitHub to get helps!

&nbsp;

## Workflow Overview

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow the process below to create a new RFC.
[Read "RFC-001 RFC Process"](/rfc/001-rfc-process/) for the detailed guide.
&nbsp;

1. Fork the repository on Git
2. Write up a RFC
3. Submit the PR (Pull Request)
4. Pick up comments and re-submit!

&nbsp;

## Before creating an RFC

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before start drafting up a new RFC:

- **Search if there is already a similar RFC**\
  If thre are already similar RFCs, you could consdier modifying (pull request)
  the existing one other than starting from scratch. Even if they are not
  exactly the same and you decide to create a new RFC, it's good to be aware of
  the similar ones so that you can acknowledge them by adding links in your RFC.

- **Reach out to the community and discuss your idea**\
  This would be a better practice for the community since it would help to
  develop the RFC ensuring its relevance to the issue it's trying to solve.

&nbsp;

## Current limitation

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project currently accepts RFCs to be written and
presented fully in text and doesn't support any other multimedia.
