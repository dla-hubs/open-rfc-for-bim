### How to Get Started? 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the simplest term, a public repository on GitHub is used to manage all the
contents of the RFCs as well as the website itself. 

&nbsp;
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Other than hoping reading through or making posts on forums or some open letters will make positive changes to the ways how BIM will be developed and implemented through software or whatever standards, why donâ€™t we set paths on what a future implementation or development should be?

&nbsp;


### What could RFCs be about? 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is no limit to what a topic may be as long as it's related to digitial design
in AEC insdustry. RFC should be about creating a positive improvement to the
dightal design tools we use in the industry. For instance, it can be about
imrpvoring a function of:
- Softwrares
- Implmentation guidelines/ standards
- APIs or other frameworks related to the software devs.


&nbsp;

### Create a new RFC 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Before you start drafting up a new RFC, do:
1. search on the existing RFC and see if there are alaready RFCs covering the similar topics as the one you are thiinking. In that case, you might want to consider modifying the existing one instead other than starting from the sctrach.  
&nbsp;


### PR on an existing RFC 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The project was started by an individual in AEC industry who is frustrated with the current status of developments and implementations of BIM (Building Information Modelling).
