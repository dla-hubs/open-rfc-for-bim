# What is this about?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open RFC for BIM is an open-source project that aims
to bring a usability-driven approach to the development and implementation of
BIM. The platform is a repository of proposals to improve the usability of BIM
for everyday practices in the AEC industry. A usability-driven approach means a
BIM process that works and is fun to work with.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A BIM standard is usually good at prescribing what
it should be, but not how it can be applied in practice to do things better than
before. For instance, BIM as implemented today is seen as nothing more than a
box-ticking exercise or unnecessary overhead. Perhaps, what has been prescribed
is simply not good enough for everyday practices. The platform challenges to
change that by bringing together ideas and proposals that could make working
with BIM more fun in the form of RFC.

&nbsp;

# RFC Process for BIM

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RFC (Request for Comments) is a process widely used
in software development to allow the user community to comment on a new feature
before it gets developed and implemented. An RFC doesn’t necessarily have to be
written by the software developers themselves but by the actual users to propose
new features or have a say on how things should work. Through the RFC and
subsequent comments on the RFC, it creates a process than can ensure a better
decision-making process for improving software or systems.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, BIM is defined and developed by the
standard development organization bodies without much consideration for the
actual implementations. Such a responsibility of deciding the implementations
are usually left to big software companies through the development of BIM
software such as Revit. And, at the practice level, it’s by BIM managers or
specialists to decide how BIM should be executed. Voices of the end-users are
clearly overlooked in the current system.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The goal of this open RFC for BIM project is to not
dismiss any of that. Rather, it’s all about extending the development of BIM by
involving more parties like the end-users. By giving an opportunity for them to
question and comment on how BIM has been setup through the RFCs. And also by
bringing together the opinions of all the parties, the platform aims to be a
collective opinion leader in making BIM more useful and usable, which in lots of
ways is not the case in reality today.

&nbsp;

# Implementations

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the platform doesn't own or develop any of
standards, guidance, or software which are subject to the RFCs, it's up to the
audiences of the platform to decide how to implement or use any of the RFCs on
the platform with or without the attributions to the platform and the RFC.
