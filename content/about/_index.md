### What is this about? 


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The project was started by an individual in AEC industry who is frustrated with the current status of developments and implementations of BIM (Building Information Modelling).

&nbsp;
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Other than hoping reading through or making posts on forums or some open letters will make positive changes to the ways how BIM will be developed and implemented through software or whatever standards, why donâ€™t we set paths on what a future implementation or development should be ourselves?

&nbsp;


### RFC for Changes
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
RFC (Request for Comments) is a process widely used in software development to get comments and create discussions before new features are implemented. The core value of the process is for software developers to ensure that whatever the new feature would be something useful and beneficial for the wide part of the actual users. 

&nbsp;
