# What is this about?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open RFC for BIM is an open-source project that aims
to bring a usability-driven approach to the development and implementation of
BIM. The platform is a repository of proposals to improve the usability of BIM
for everyday practices in the AEC industry. A usability-driven approach means a
BIM process that works and is fun to work with.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A BIM standard is usually good at prescribing what
it should be, but not how it can be applied in practice to do things better than
before. For instance, BIM as implemented today is seen as nothing more than a
box-ticking exercise or unnecessary overhead. Perhaphs, what have been
prescribed are simply not good enough for the evereyda practices. The platform
challenges to change that by bringing together ideas and proposals that could
make working with BIM more fun in the form of RFC.

&nbsp;

# Why RFC for BIM?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RFC (Request for Comments) is a process widely used
in software development to give an opportunity for the user community to comment
on a new feature before it gets developed and implemented. A RFC doesn't
necesary have to be written by the software developers themselves but by the
actual users. Through the RFC process, the software developers can ensure that a
new feature they work on is something benefitial for the wide part of the user
community.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By bring the opinions of the communities togather,
the platform aims to be a collective opinion leader in making BIM more usable
and useful for the end users.
